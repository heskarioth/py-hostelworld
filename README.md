## General info
I consider myself to be an avid reader. When I am not working, studying, exercising or writing, then I am spending my time reading a book. This means that if I was to buy every single book I have read or own, I'd in debt big times by now. For this reason, I always try to buy my books in charity shops or online second-hand marketplaces.<br>
Usually, I would spend couple of hours every few weeks checking for the books in my current 'to-buy' reading list. When your current list comprises over 100 books, this manual process becomes, incredible inefficient and boring.<br>
What if we can make python this machine task for us? <br>
Meet <b>Automating-booksearch</b>. <br> 
All you have to do is provide it with the list of isbns books you're looking for (i.e. the script, automatically extracts them for your current 'to-read' list in your Goodreads profile), and the bookscraper will do the rest. It will check <b>abebooks</b> and <b>Book Depository</b>, compare them, and report back for each book in which marketplace we can get the best deal price.

In this way, we can check for book deals every single day without having to burn out all the few brain neurons we're left with (and use them in more interesting things) :).
